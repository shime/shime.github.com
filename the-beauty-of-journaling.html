            <p>Journaling is one of my favorite habits, and I love it. I do it almost every day. If you&#39;re not sure about the value it provides and are thinking about quitting it, this article is for you.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve started journaling two years ago, and I&#39;ve been doing it on and off for a while. I&#39;ve since become more regular with it.</p>

<p>At first, I didn&#39;t understand it. It was nice to remember what happened during the day and to write down my thoughts. It felt like a conversation. I could go on and on about events and exciting things that I&#39;ve thought or experienced. </p>

<p>I thought the primary value of journaling was the sentimental value it provides. In a couple of years, I&#39;ll read these entries and amuse myself by all the changes that happened. I&#39;ll witness how much wiser I&#39;ve become. How I had all these silly thoughts and worried about things that never happened.</p>

<p>While this is true, that is not the main benefit of journaling. It took me two years to discover that. But more on that later. </p>

<p>First, I have to explain why I&#39;ve ditched journaling many times and why I was so sporadic about it. You might identify some of the problems in <em>your</em> journaling practice.</p>

<h2>Journaling at the wrong time of the day</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve tried out journaling at every possible time of the day and even many times a day. In the morning and before going to sleep. After a bunch of trial and error, I&#39;ve found out that mornings are the best time for journaling for me. If I do it before going to sleep, I&#39;m rushing it and am not thinking enough. It feels forced, and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve quit it many times.</p>

<h2>Journaling by following prompts from other people</h2>

<p>This is another problem that made me quit. I would find a prompt from someone and copy it to my journal. After some reflection, I&#39;ve found out the reason behind this. It is my feeling of inadequacy when it comes to journaling. Believing that I&#39;m doing it wrong and that those other people will show me how to do it. That&#39;s the reason why I started writing twice a day in the first place. A template I&#39;ve copied had prompts for both morning and evening. How dumb.</p>

<p>Prompts also asked me what I&#39;m grateful for or what amazing things have happened. It turns out writing what I&#39;m grateful for doesn&#39;t make me more grateful and feels repetitive. Writing about amazing things that have happened is better. I&#39;ve incorporated that into my <a href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam</a> database. I don&#39;t use it only inside the journal; I use it all over the place by tagging amazing things that happen. Tagging makes it possible to look at all the great things that happened at a glance, that I usually forget. Now, <em>this</em> makes me grateful.</p>

<p>I always tend to try to improve things, which is why I search for templates and systems. This article will also suggest a system. Oh, the irony.</p>

<h2>Journaling about things that don&#39;t matter</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve made another error with journaling. I wrote about things that are not interesting to me but felt like they should belong in a journal. This made the journaling experience boring and made me quit journaling again. If it&#39;s boring, why am I doing it?</p>

<p>The only hobbies worth keeping are those that increase my energy. Those that fulfill me and make me happier. It&#39;s my free time, after all. The best way to spend it is to do things that I love doing. To <a href="/do-whatever-you-can&#x27;t-stop-thinking-about">do whatever I can&#39;t stop thinking about</a>.</p>

<h2>Not journaling because it drains my energy for writing</h2>

<p>This is another stupid mistake I&#39;ve made. I thought I have to preserve my energy for writing articles and that I waste that energy by journaling. In fact, the exact opposite is true. I&#39;ve written and published most articles when I was journaling.</p>

<h2>Morning Pages</h2>

<p>After years of on-and-off journaling, I&#39;ve finally found a style that suits me. I journal first thing in the morning, and I write at least 750 words.</p>

<p>This is the practice of Morning Pages. Many people are writing about the benefits of doing this regularly. The benefits include reducing anxiety and clearing your mind.</p>

<p>While I&#39;ve noticed these benefits, the most significant advantage is that I get new ideas. I bump into them, and Morning Pages encourage me to write about them. I discover more of them.</p>

<p>Another significant benefit is that I learn to silence the inner critic. That nagging feeling that my writing is not good enough. To fight it, I let the words flow out of me, and I don&#39;t worry about what I&#39;m writing.</p>

<p>These two things are the reason I journal daily, and I&#39;ll continue to do so. I&#39;m sacrificing the sentimental value. I don&#39;t go into too much detail about events that have happened. The sentimental value the journal provides is extra, so I&#39;m willing to sacrifice that.</p>

<h2>It&#39;s not universal</h2>

<p>Finally, if you have to take one thing from this long article, understand this. Many people claim that there is no right or wrong way to journal. I want to change that claim a bit: There is no <em>universally</em> right or wrong way to journal. No one can serve you the &quot;best journaling template&quot;. It&#39;s different for every person. It&#39;s like the question: &quot;What&#39;s the meaning of life?&quot;. There is no single answer that applies to everyone, and journaling is the same.</p>

<p>You can journal wrong, and you&#39;ll know it if you feel it in your gut. If you don&#39;t look forward to it and don&#39;t enjoy it, you&#39;ll quit. That might not be because you hate journaling, but because you use the wrong style. Find your style. Try different things. You might just find out how beautiful it is.</p>
