      <title>Why I've decided to switch to Hey</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Hey came out, I wasn&amp;#39;t sure that I&amp;#39;m going to use it. But, I was interested in trying it out. I thought it was an overpriced email client and that there is too much hype around it. The App store drama didn&amp;#39;t help. Yet, I was interested in it since I would like to stop using Gmail as my primary email address.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The law of ever-increasing entropy</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&amp;quot; These are the famous words of Leo Tolstoy. But why is that the case? It all boils down to the law of ever-increasing entropy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Word Rafting</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a crazy idea in the morning two months ago. I was drinking a lot the night before, and that usually causes waking up earlier and with some unusual ideas. I&amp;#39;ve decided to start an online writing group.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing Regularly</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve stopped writing regularly. I&amp;#39;ve published a couple of articles about personal knowledge management and stopped. I&amp;#39;ve broken the habit. I&amp;#39;m trying to get back to it now, but at the time I felt that there is nothing else to say about the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
