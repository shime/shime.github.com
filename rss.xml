      <title>The overreaction paradox</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My bike got stolen a while back. It happened because I got lazy carrying my bike up the stairs and left it in the much less secure basement. I thought that taking it up the stairs is not worth it. Nothing will happen. No one will steal a bike from my building since it hasn&amp;#39;t happened to any of my neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Write for yourself</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a tension that you’ll discover if you start publishing articles. A tension between writing what the world wants from you and what you want to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beware of programming puzzles</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most common piece of advice you&amp;#39;ll receive if you want to learn programming is that you should do programming to learn it. While this is well-meaning advice, since doing programming is better than reading about it, it&amp;#39;s incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Knowing the port one is sailing to</title>
      
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Writing Bear templates with Automator and Ruby</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bear is one of my favorite apps. It&amp;#39;s simple, has a fantastic minimalist design, and uses Markdown. I&amp;#39;m happy to support its development since it&amp;#39;s one of the rare apps that delight me. But, I&amp;#39;ve also noticed that some features are missing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing-guided reading</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are so many great books to read, but so little time to do it. How to pick a book from a list of hundreds or even thousands of recommended books to read?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I've decided to switch to Hey</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Hey came out, I wasn&amp;#39;t sure that I&amp;#39;m going to use it. But, I was interested in trying it out. I thought it was an overpriced email client and that there is too much hype around it. The App store drama didn&amp;#39;t help. Yet, I was interested in it since I would like to stop using Gmail as my primary email address.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The law of ever-increasing entropy</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&amp;quot; These are the famous words of Leo Tolstoy. But why is that the case? It all boils down to the law of ever-increasing entropy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Word rafting</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a crazy idea in the morning two months ago. I was drinking a lot the night before, and that usually causes waking up earlier and with some unusual ideas. I&amp;#39;ve decided to start an online writing group.&lt;/p&gt;
