      <title>Build aspirins for friends</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a developer, I easily get carried away building new things. Side projects are fun for me, especially when they are useful. In fact, I actively avoid programming that is useful only as a learning exercise, like puzzles and tests. Instead of that, I try to build useful things.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing a lot is not enough</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve published an article or a book review every week for the past six months. But is publishing consistently the right thing to do to get better at writing?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why you should keep a learning journal</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a learning journal since 2011, but only recently have I realized the main benefit from it: it makes me learn more by paying more attention to bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My experience with switching apps for personal knowledge management</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Personal knowledge management (PKM) is the best thing I discovered in 2019. I&amp;#39;ve since tried a couple of different approaches and too many (six) apps. In this article, I would like to share everything I&amp;#39;ve learned about it over that period.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When magic works against you</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first encountered this concern in the Rails app that I was working on, I was initially impressed. It felt like magic. Like a cool trick to avoid unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The importance of detachment</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;All my previous side projects flopped because of this. I looked at them from the perspective of a creator. I was stuck in that role. I didn’t have the experience of all the other people that were supposed to use the end product.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The overreaction paradox</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My bike got stolen a while back. It happened because I got lazy carrying my bike up the stairs and left it in the much less secure basement. I thought that taking it up the stairs is not worth it. Nothing will happen. No one will steal a bike from my building since it hasn&amp;#39;t happened to any of my neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Write for yourself</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a tension that you’ll discover if you start publishing articles. A tension between writing what the world wants from you and what you want to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beware of programming puzzles</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most common piece of advice you&amp;#39;ll receive if you want to learn programming is that you should do programming to learn it. While this is well-meaning advice, since doing programming is better than reading about it, it&amp;#39;s incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Knowing the port one is sailing to</title>
      
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
