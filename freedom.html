  <p>I&#39;m a freelancer and I love what I do. There is a thing I value the most in this type of work.</p>

<p>That thing is freedom.</p>

<hr>

<p>It&#39;s not about working when you feel like it, since there is no schedule. I used to think that was great, not having to
wake up at 7am every day. Well I was wrong. I came to the conclusion that working early in the morning is the best for me and I feel
the most productive at that time. It&#39;s a healthy, natural thing to do - so I wake up early.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about not having to commute to your work. I used to think that was great too, not having
to spend so much time in traffic and all. Well I was wrong again. Being around people at work
motivates me more. Having an office space makes the work/life boundary tangible. It&#39;s great
for my motivation and work/life separation - so I commute.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about being able to travel. I used to think that was great, being able
to work while traveling. Well guess who was wrong again. It doesn&#39;t work for me - so I don&#39;t work
while traveling.</p>

<hr>

<p>So what freedom am I talking about?</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about freedom to work internationally. Not being restriced by location. That&#39;s the type of
freedom I value the most. I don&#39;t have to choose from a pool of locally available companies to work for,
my pool is the entire world. A world of companies willing to hire remotely.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s the greatest freedom that you could get with work and I love freelancing because of that.</p>
