      <title>Stop thinking what others would like to read</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a writer, you can fall into the trap of thinking about your readers too much. Will they like what you write? Will it resonate? But, the best writing is the one you don’t care how many people read. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;René Descartes famously said that reading books is like a conversation with the finest minds of past centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Build aspirins for friends</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a developer, I easily get carried away building new things. Side projects are fun for me, especially when they are useful. In fact, I actively avoid programming that is useful only as a learning exercise, like puzzles and tests. Instead of that, I try to build useful things.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Writing a lot is not enough</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve published an article or a book review every week for the past six months. But is publishing consistently the right thing to do to get better at writing?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why you should keep a learning journal</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a learning journal since 2011, but only recently have I realized the main benefit from it: it makes me learn more by paying more attention to bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My experience with switching apps for personal knowledge management</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Personal knowledge management (PKM) is the best thing I discovered in 2019. I&amp;#39;ve since tried a couple of different approaches and too many (six) apps. In this article, I would like to share everything I&amp;#39;ve learned about it over that period.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When magic works against you</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first encountered this concern in the Rails app that I was working on, I was initially impressed. It felt like magic. Like a cool trick to avoid unnecessary complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The importance of detachment</title>
      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;All my previous side projects flopped because of this. I looked at them from the perspective of a creator. I was stuck in that role. I didn’t have the experience of all the other people that were supposed to use the end product.&lt;/p&gt;
